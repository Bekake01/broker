Any dispute, controversy, or claim between the parties arising out of or relating in any way to these TERMS, an Order, Montway’s services or any other Customer engagement with Montway will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that Customer or Montway (1) must assert claims in small claims court if Customer’s or our claims qualify, and (2) bring suit in any court of competent jurisdiction to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights, including with respect to temporary restraining orders. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law shall apply to this arbitration agreement.


There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages).


At least thirty (30) days before beginning an arbitration proceeding, Customer must send an individualized letter personally signed by Customer and identifying Customer, Customer’s legal claims, the requested relief and requesting arbitration to Montway – 425 N. Martingale Rd., Suite 550, Schaumburg, IL 60173 by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS or USPS express mail (signature required). We will do the same; except in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for Customer, by electronic mail to the last known address. Except as otherwise stated herein, the arbitration will be conducted by the National Arbitration Mediation (“NAM”) under its rules, including for Consumer-Related Disputes. Customer and Montway also agree to delegate the issue of arbitrability to an arbitrator. Payment of administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the NAM’s rules, except all of the filing fees will be paid by the filing party. If Customer is a prevailing party, Customer may seek reimbursement of Customer’s fees and costs. However, Montway may seek our attorney’s fees and costs if the arbitration finds Customer’s claims to be frivolous. There will be only one arbitrator, not a panel. Customer may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where Customer lives or at another mutually agreed location. Customer and Montway also agree that, if more than one dispute arises regarding the same or substantially similar issues, the parties’ respective claim(s) will be arbitrated in the order in which it/they were filed, except all claims shall be arbitrated within three (3) years. THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WILL SURVIVE TERMINATION OF THESE TERMS.


b. Class Action Waiver. The parties each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings or lawsuits, whether in arbitration or in a court of law, will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class or representative action. Therefore, Customer waives all rights to bring claims on behalf of a class of persons; however, Customer may still bring an individual claim for public injunctive relief and in small claims court. Nothing in this provision, however, should operate to prevent the parties from settling claims on a class-wide basis or otherwise coordinating claims filed in arbitration.


c. Enforceability. If this arbitration agreement is invalidated in whole or part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction in the section below entitled “Governing Law; Jurisdiction” shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to these Terms.


d. Jury Trial and Small Claims Court. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the parties each waive any right to a jury trial. The parties also both agree that Customer or Montway may bring suit in any court of competent jurisdiction to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights, including with respect to temporary restraining orders.


13. Additional Terms for California Residents

Code § 1789.3, California users are entitled to know that they may file grievances and complaints with the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs, in writing at 1625 North Market Blvd., Suite N 112, Sacramento CA 95834, or by telephone at (916) 445-1254 or (800) 952-5210 or by email at dca@dca.ca.gov.


14. Governing Law; Jurisdiction

These TERMS shall be construed in accordance with Title 49, United States Code and be governed by the laws of the State of Illinois without regard to any conflict of law principles. Further, the parties agree to the jurisdiction of a state or federal court in the State of Illinois to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with these TERMS (and any non-contractual disputes and/or claims relating to or arising in connection with it) and that is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 12 above.


15. Miscellaneous

a. Nothing contained in these TERMS or Customer’s use of Montway’s services shall be construed to constitute either party as a partner, joint venturer, employee or agent of the other party, nor shall either party hold itself out as such. Neither party has any right or authority to incur, assume or create, in writing or otherwise, any warranty, liability or other obligation of any kind, express or implied, in the name of or on behalf of the other party, it being intended by both parties that each shall remain independent contractors responsible for its own actions.

b. Except as expressly set forth in these TERMS, Customer may not assign any rights hereunder without Montway’s prior written consent. These TERMS are binding on and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

c. If any provision of these TERMS shall be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these TERMS will otherwise remain in full force and effect.

d. These TERMS supersede all prior written or oral representations and constitute the entire agreement between Customer and Montway and may not be changed by anyone except for Montway. Customer warrants that Customer has read these TERMS in their entirety and by continuing with the transaction, fully understands and agrees to them.

e. Customer waives any claims or defenses based in whole or in part on Customer not having read, not knowing, or not understanding these TERMS.

f. The failure of Montway to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these TERMS shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. Any waiver of these TERMS by Montway must be in writing and signed by an authorized representative of Montway.

g. Montway reserves the right to use Customer’s name and/or Montway name, logo, and trademarks and to identify Customer as a Montway customer, and for other similar marketing or promotional purposes on Montway’s websites and in other communications and collateral materials provided to with existing or potential Montway customers, partners, and investors. To decline Montway this right Customer must email privacy@montway.com stating that Customer does not wish to be used as a reference.

h. These TERMS constitute the entire agreement between Customer and Montway and govern the terms and conditions of Customer’s use of our services, and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral or written, between Customer and Montway with respect to such services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer may also be subject to additional terms and conditions, posted policies (including but not limited to the Privacy Policy), guidelines, or rules that may apply when Customer uses Montway’s services.
